      <blockquote>My name is Alexander Hamilton, and there’s a million things I haven’t done. But just you wait, just you wait.</blockquote>
      <p>The orphan Alexander Hamilton leaves his home on the island of Nevis ("Alexander Hamilton"). After arriving in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets Aaron Burr, John Laurens, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Hercules Mulligan ("Aaron Burr, Sir"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills ("My Shot"). They affirm their revolutionary goals to each other ("The Story of Tonight"). Meanwhile, wealthy sisters Angelica, Eliza, and Peggy Schuyler go into town seeking out potential suitors ("The Schuyler Sisters"). Samuel Seabury warns everyone about the dangers of Congress, but Hamilton disagrees and tries to counter Seabury ("Farmer Refuted"). King George then insists on his authority ("You'll Be Back"). During the New York and New Jersey campaign, Hamilton accepts a position as George Washington's aide-de-camp ("Right Hand Man"), instead of field command.

      <p class="example"> At Philip Schuyler's ball ("A Winter's Ball"), Eliza Schuyler falls hopelessly in love with Alexander, who reciprocates her feelings, and the two marry ("Helpless"), as Angelica suppresses her feelings for the sake of their happiness at the wedding ("Satisfied"). After the wedding, Burr congratulates Hamilton on his position as aide-de-camp to Washington; Hamilton admits that he would much rather have Burr's position on the battlefield ("The Story of Tonight (Reprise)"). Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his own career as more cautious ("Wait For It"). 
      </p>
      <p> As conditions worsen for the Continental Army, Hamilton aids Laurens in a duel against Charles Lee ("Stay Alive"), who had insulted Washington. Laurens injures Lee, who yields ("Ten Duel Commandments"). Hamilton is temporarily suspended by Washington ("Meet Me Inside") over the duel and is sent home. There, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with her first child, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives ("That Would Be Enough"). After Lafayette persuades France to get involved on the colonists' side ("Guns and Ships"), he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final Siege of Yorktown. Washington agrees but explains to Hamilton—who is convinced he should die a martyr and a hero in war—that he should be careful with his actions because whatever he does will be known for ages to come ("History Has Its Eyes on You"). At the Siege of Yorktown, Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out how to trap the British and win the war ("Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)").
